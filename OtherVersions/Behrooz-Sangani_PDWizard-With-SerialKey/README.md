## Package & Deployment Setup Enhanced Version \(Shareware Registration Feature Added\!\)


</div>

### Description

You probably pack your apps with VB Setup program. You do not have money to buy a fancy installer. You want to make money from your programming. I changed the VB default SETUP1.exe project and now the installer asks end users to provide a registration key. The end users have to provide their PC ID generated from their HD serial number to get a reg key so the setup will never run on two PCs with a certain reg key. The unzipped setup1.exe file is only 32 kb bigger than the original version!

Included is a KeyGen project that generates registration keys for users and saves them in a database for future reference. You can track all registered users if they needed support and....

This is the first release of my changes to SETUP1 project. If you liked it please come back and leave comments or votes.
